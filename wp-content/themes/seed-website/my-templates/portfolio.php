				<p><i>“Seed Publicity were recommended to us by another local business who were very pleased with the service & results that they had received. We were Initially skeptical having used SEO / SEM / PPC agencies in the past who promised much but never seemed to deliver, however Seed confidently assured us in our initial meeting that for a modest initial investment in their services we would see specific, defined results within six months.</i></p>

				<p><i>To our pleasant surprise they not only delivered the results that they had committed to, but then exceeded them – which they have continued to do ever since!</i></p>
 
				<p><i>In the year since we have worked with Seed, they have continued to deliver improvements in ROI, and have also gone beyond their initial mandate resolving issues arising from a technical issue with the site, and pro-actively suggesting site and content improvements to continue to take our online business forward.</i></p>
 
				<p><i>We view the team at Seed Publicity not as an agency but as part of our company and unreservedly recommend them.”</i></p>
